# We-Rate-Dogs
This project makes part of the coursework leading to Udacity's Data Analysis Nanodegree. Its objective is to demonstrate skills for the Data Wrangling phase of the Data Analysis Process. Data Wrangling is a key part in analytics, and is typically described as the one where analysts and data scientists spend the most part of their time.

The project gathers data from different sources related to the WeRateDogs twitter account, which posts and rates photos of folowers' dogs. After assessing and cleaning the data, reports are written to communicate the results of an initial analysis.
